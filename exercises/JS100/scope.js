//What's my Value (Part 1)

//What's my Value (Part 2)
The code will return a ReferenceError since greeting is not accessible.

//What's my Value (Part 3)

//What's my Value (Part 4)
The code will log 1 since the if conditional is true.

//What's my Value (Part 5)
The code will log undefined since variable 'a' is not defined yet when the console.log on line 5 is executed.

//What's my Value (Part 6)
The code will log false because b = false in the global scope.

//What's my Value (Part 7)
The code will log 1 as the console.log execution will look up the scope chain to find variable 'a'.

//What's my Value (Part 8)
The code will log 2 since the console.log variable is referring to the argument passed into the function.
This is a case of variable shadowing.
