#6 Getting Things Done
There is no break condition for recursion.

#7 Neutralizer
When an element of the sentence is deleted in the each method, the index
of the elements is reassigned to i - 1 for all elements in the array after
the deleted elmeent. Therefore, the next element after a deleted element
is skipped.
